  Shocktubes are commonly used to generate high enthalpy flows in which to conduct ground-based research at hypersonic flight relevant conditions, and as well-controlled high-temperature and pressure environments in which to validate optical sensors. The MATLAB code provided here implements a method of characteristics solver that can be used to design shock tubes to achieve a desired range of target conditions, or to predict post-incident and post-reflected shock states and test time duration.
