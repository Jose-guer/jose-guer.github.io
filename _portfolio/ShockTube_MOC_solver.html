  Shocktubes are commonly used in research to generate high enthalpy flows in which to conduct aerodynamic studies, as high-temperature and pressure enviornments in which to conduct chemical kinetics experiments, and as well-control environments in which to validate optical sensors. The MATLAB code provided here, implements a method of characterisitics solver that can be used to design shocktube to achieve a certain range of target conditions, or to predicit post-incident and post-reflected shock states and test time duration.
