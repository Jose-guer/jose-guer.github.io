Abstract

Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) has emerged as a versatile and reliable diagnostic tool for measuring temperature, pressure, gas composition, and velocity in power generation and propulsion systems. This paper provides a comprehensive review of TDLAS principles and practical considerations for sensor design and implementation. The discussion begins with a mathematical introduction to the theory of gas absorption including: lineshape modeling and broadening mechanisms, quantitative measurements and challenges, and practical line selection rules. The analysis progresses to wavelength-modulation spectroscopy (WMS), highlighting its advantages in noise rejection and robustness in harsh environments. Furthermore, the calibration-free WMS model and the connection between WMS harmonics and lineshape derivatives is derived. Quantitative measurements through use of multiple harmonics is discussed and challenges surrounding measurement rate are presented. The end of the discussion focuses on practical aspects regarding the implementation of scanned-WMS sensors including laser characterization, background subtraction, and hardware debugging.
